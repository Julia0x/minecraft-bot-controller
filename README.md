# Minecraft Bot Controller

## Overview

**Minecraft Bot Controller** is a bot powered by [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer), designed to automate various in-game actions in Minecraft. The bot can perform tasks such as attacking specific mobs, equipping armor and weapons, and automatically eating food when its hunger level is low. It also provides a console interface for issuing commands and controlling its behavior in real time.

## Features

- **Automatic Combat:** The bot can find and attack specific mobs like Zombified Piglins and Wither Skeletons.
- **Kill Aura Mode:** Automatically track and attack the nearest mob within range.
- **Auto-Eat:** When hunger drops below a threshold, the bot will automatically eat to replenish its food bar.
- **Auto Armor Equip:** Automatically equips the best available armor when needed.
- **Console Commands:** Control the bot through console commands for attacking, chatting, equipping armor, and more.
- **Customizable:** Easily customize behavior by adjusting configurations in the `config.json` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>

    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

4. **Create a `config.json` file:**

    Inside the project folder, create a `config.json` file with your Minecraft server settings:
    ```json
    {
      "host": "your-server-ip",
      "port": your-server-port,
      "username": "bot-username"
    }
    ```

5. **Run the bot:**

    node bot.js
    ```

## Console Commands
